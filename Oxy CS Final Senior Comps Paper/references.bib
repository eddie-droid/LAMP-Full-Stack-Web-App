abstract = {Clinical decision support tools (DST) promise improved healthcare outcomes by offering data-driven insights. While effective in lab settings, almost all DSTs have failed in practice. Empirical research diagnosed poor contextual fit as the cause. This paper describes the design and field evaluation of a radically new form of DST. It automatically generates slides for clinicians' decision meetings with subtly embedded machine prognostics. This design took inspiration from the notion of Unremarkable Computing, that by augmenting the users' routines technology/AI can have significant importance for the users yet remain unobtrusive. Our field evaluation suggests clinicians are more likely to encounter and embrace such a DST. Drawing on their responses, we discuss the importance and intricacies of finding the right level of unremarkableness in DST design, and share lessons learned in prototyping critical AI systems as a situated experience.},

abstract = {Greenspace exposure is associated with psychological benefits. In this systematic review, we summarized and critically evaluated the literature on the relationship between greenspace exposure (i.e., objective and subjective assessments of interactions with nature) and psychopathology incidence and symptom severity in those with and without a clinical diagnosis. A secondary aim of our review was to examine potential interactions between greenspace exposure and urban environmental features (e.g., pollution, population density) associated with poorer mental health. We identified 40 studies published between January 1, 1981, and July 31, 2020, from PubMed and PsycINFO electronic database search. Although heterogeneous in assessments of greenspace exposure and psychopathology symptom domain, the majority of cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence found that objectively assessed greenspace exposure (e.g., satellite measures of greenery) was related to less severe symptoms and lower incidence of psychopathology in children (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms) and adults (e.g., depression symptoms). In addition, five studies that assessed urban environmental features suggest that greenspace exposure may show a net positive relationship with psychopathology over and above the absence of urban features. We discuss limitations of the literature and future directions, including more mechanistic work to delineate the potential cognitive, affective, and behavioral factors that may contribute to the beneficial relationship between greenspace exposure and psychological health.}

However, unaccompanied migrant youth (UMY) still struggle in accessing appropriate mental health resources in spite of their high need for mental health support. Through co-design workshops, and using the lens of the social-ecological model of resilience, we explored the social-ecological factors that support or hinder UMY’s use of mental health apps as resources. We identified the strong influence of the macro-system (i.e. resettlement policies) on the bio-and micro-systems, which in turn limits participants’ abilities to use the apps. Our findings highlight the factors specific to each social-ecological system—including personal experiences, technological infrastructure and social environment—that need to be accounted for when designing technological mental health resources for UMY. This contributes: a rich description of the interplay of mental health apps with social-ecological systems in which UMY are embedded; and the corresponding design considerations.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems}, articleno = {541}, numpages = {19}, keywords = {Youth, Asylum-Seekers, Ecology, Marginalized, Mental Health, Refugees, Social-Ecological}, location = {Yokohama, Japan}, series = {CHI '21} }
